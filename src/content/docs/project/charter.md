title: Finntegrate Project Charter
description: Finntegrate Project Charter
---

Finntegrate aims to create an accessible, multilingual support system for immigrants to Finland through the lens of information science and user-centered design. 

## Project Mission

Our mission is to help immigrants navigate complex bureaucratic processes by understanding their information behaviors, identifying barriers, and facilitating effective information retrieval.

## Project Vision

Finntegrate envisions a future where immigrants in Finland have seamless access to the information and services they need to thrive. Key elements of our vision:

* **Task-based information seeking** - Research-based understanding of how immigrants complete bureaucratic tasks
* **Barrier identification** - Recognizing and addressing common obstacles in information access
* **Information interaction framework** - Using established information science principles to guide system design
* **AI-enhanced personalization** - Leveraging technology to provide guidance tailored to each immigrant's specific situation, language, and information needs

## Problem Statement: Information Interaction Challenges

Immigrants to Finland face numerous information-seeking and interaction challenges that can be grouped into the following categories:

### Systemic Fragmentation
* **Fragmented information landscape** - Information scattered across multiple websites and government agencies (Migri, Kela, Vero, DVV, TE-services)
* **Complex bureaucratic processes** - Frequently changing requirements and procedures with interdependencies
* **Cross-agency information gaps** - Lack of coordination between different government services

### Access Barriers
* **Language limitations** - Insufficient information localization in languages beyond Finnish and Swedish
* **Digital navigation obstacles** - Challenges in accessing and using online government services
* **Information discovery problems** - Difficulty finding relevant information without prior system knowledge

### Cognitive Barriers
* **High cognitive load** - Need for extensive research and information synthesis across multiple sources
* **Information anxiety** - Uncertainty and stress affecting mental wellbeing during transition
* **Bureaucratic literacy challenges** - Difficulty understanding specialized terminology and administrative structures

These challenges can lead to delays in processing, misunderstandings, missed opportunities, and unnecessary hardship for immigrants. They can also result in increased workload for support workers and government agencies.

The information-related challenges stem from fundamental misalignments in information systems design:

* Information structured around bureaucratic processes rather than immigrant information tasks
* Limited natural language information retrieval capabilities (requiring exact keywords)
* Information silos between organizations, forcing immigrants to piece together complex information
* User interfaces designed from the perspective of information providers rather than information users

## Information Interaction Framework

Drawing on academic research, Finntegrate will apply established information science frameworks to address immigrant information challenges:

* **Task-Based Information Seeking** - Understanding immigrant-centered information tasks and their stages, identifying barriers at each stage, and designing solutions that support successful task completion
* **Interactive Information Retrieval** - Creating systems that allow for simple, natural dialogue between users and information resources
* **Information Behavior Studies** - Researching how immigrants actually seek, find, and use information to inform system design
* **Information Barriers Research** - Identifying and addressing contextual barriers in cross-cultural and multilingual information environments
* **User-Centered Information Design** - Developing interfaces based on immigrants' actual information needs and behaviors
* **Designing Natural Language Interfaces** - Allowing immigrants to ask questions in their own words rather than requiring exact keywords or bureaucratic terminology
* **Integrating Cross-Organizational Knowledge** - Breaking down information silos between government agencies, civic organizations, and municipalities to provide a holistic view of immigrant information needs

By applying these frameworks, Finntegrate can provide significant value to immigrants navigating the Finnish system. The user focus ensures that information is presented in ways that match how immigrants actually think about and approach their settlement tasks, rather than how agencies organize their services.

## Strategic Opportunities

Our strategic opportunities are aligned with our primary objectives (referenced in parentheses) and ordered by priority:

1. **Designing task-centered information systems** - Organizing information around immigrant tasks rather than bureaucratic processes (Objectives 3, 4)
   
2. **Enhancing multilingual accessibility** - Developing interfaces informed by cross-language information retrieval research to support diverse linguistic needs (Objectives 1, 2)
   
3. **Simplifying bureaucratic language** - Transforming complex terminology into clear, actionable information that reduces barriers to understanding (Objectives 2, 3)
   
4. **Integrating fragmented information** - Creating cohesive information pathways across siloed government services and resources (Objectives 3, 4)
   
5. **Applying information science research** - Leveraging academic frameworks in information behavior and task-based information seeking (Objectives 1, 4, 5)
   
6. **Developing proactive assistance** - Building systems that anticipate immigrant information needs based on common patterns and journey stages (Objectives 1, 3, 4)
