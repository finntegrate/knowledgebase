# Strategic Context Map: Finnish Immigration Support Ecosystem

**Summary**  
The "Strategic Context Map: Finnish Immigration Support Ecosystem" document provides an overview of the Finnish immigration support system. Its purpose is to guide team members, align feature development with immigrant needs, and support strategic decisions for Finntegrate. The document outlines the immigrant journey, key phases, common pain points, and stakeholder organizations like Migri, TE Offices, and Kela. It also details information sources (migri.fi, infofinland.fi), everyday information needs, technology opportunities like multilingual resource aggregation and process navigation, and the Finntegrate vision. The document concludes with a prototype roadmap and lessons from Migri's Kamu chatbot, emphasizing reliable information retrieval and accessibility.

## Document Purpose

This living document provides a comprehensive overview of the Finnish immigration support ecosystem to:

- Orient team members to the broader context of our work
- Ensure feature development aligns with immigrant needs
- Prevent siloed thinking focused on single organizations or processes
- Serve as a reference point when prioritizing features and initiatives
- Support strategic decision-making throughout the project lifecycle

"Central to this analysis is the perspective of the immigrant user... Successfully designing a valuable support tool necessitates a deep understanding of the user journey. Research indicates that migrants often face significant barriers related to language, digital skills, and understanding administrative processes when accessing public services."

## Lessons from Previous Digital Initiatives

### Migri's Kamu Chatbot Experience

- Launched in 2018, discontinued in October 2024
- Initially, improved service access compared to phone lines
- Later faced technical problems and security/misuse concerns
- It was ultimately determined not to provide sufficient value to meet user needs

### Key Takeaways for Finntegrate

- **Focus on core value**: Prioritize reliable information retrieval rather than attempting potentially fragile predictive functions
- **Build and maintain trust**: Prioritize accuracy, transparency, and reliability in all information provided
- **Manage expectations**: Clearly communicate the tool's capabilities and limitations
- **Avoid sensitive data handling**: Be cautious with features involving personal data
- **Continuous improvement**: Plan for ongoing development based on user feedback and changing needs

### Strategic Niche for Finntegrate

Finntegrate's strategic niche lies in serving as a trustworthy, multilingual information aggregator and navigator for Finland's complex immigration and integration landscape. It does not aim to replace official e-services or offer personalized legal counsel, but rather to make existing official information and services more discoverable, understandable, and accessible.
