# Copilot Instructions for Finntegrate Knowledge Base

This document provides guidance for AI assistants (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) when working with this codebase. Following these instructions will ensure consistent and project-appropriate code assistance.

## Project Overview

- **Project Type**: Documentation/knowledge base site
- **Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build/) with [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) documentation theme
- **Primary Languages**: Markdown/MDX for content, TypeScript/JavaScript for configuration
- **Purpose**: Research and knowledge base for the Finntegrate project

## Development Environment

### Package Management

- **Always use pnpm** for package management, not npm or yarn
- Use commands like `pnpm install`, `pnpm add [package]`, and `pnpm run [script]`
- The project's development server is run with `pnpm run dev`

### Project Structure

- `/src/content/docs/` - All documentation content lives here
  - Content is organized into subdirectories like `guides/`, `reference/`, etc.
- `/src/assets/` - Static assets like images
- `/public/` - Files that should be copied to the build output directory

## Content Guidelines

### Documentation Files

- All documentation should be in Markdown (.md) or MDX (.mdx) format
- Each file must include frontmatter with at least `title` and `description` fields

### Example Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: Feature Name
description: Brief description of what this page covers
---
```

## Configuration

- Starlight configuration is in `astro.config.mjs`
- When adding new documentation pages, they should be added to the sidebar configuration or at least appear in a page listing

## Best Practices

- Use relative links for internal documentation references
- Use proper Markdown heading hierarchy (start each file with an H1, then H2, etc.)
- Include alt text for all images
- Keep code examples concise and well-commented
- For code blocks, specify the language for proper syntax highlighting

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Documentation Page

1. Create a new .md or .mdx file in the appropriate directory under `/src/content/docs/`
2. Include required frontmatter (title, description)
3. Add the page to the sidebar configuration in `astro.config.mjs` if it's not in an autogenerated directory

## Repository Rules

- Consider accessibility when proposing UI changes or content additions
- Keep documentation concise, accurate, and user-focused
